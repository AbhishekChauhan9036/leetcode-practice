/**
 * JumpSearch: search from an sorted array by jumping ahead fixed number of steps every time.
 *
 * Time complexity:
 *    - O(âˆšn). Between Linear Search O(n) and Binary Search O(Logn).
 *    - Wosrt case: (n/m) + m-1, where n is number of elements, m is number of steps every time.
 * Space complexity: O(1).
 *
 * Start from the leftmost element of the array, and jump m number of elements
 * every time then compare x with current element.
 *    - If found, return the index;
 *    - Else if current is less than x, keep jumping;
 *    - Else if current is larger than x, do linear search between last element and current one;
 *    - Otherwise, not found, return -1.
